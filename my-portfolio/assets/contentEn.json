    "title": "About",
    "description": "Hi, my name is Henrique Galinha, born in 1999. I am a former special forces paratrooper with 5 years of service, where I also worked as a parachute packer and instructor for multiple courses.\n\nI thrive in team environments, stay calm and focused under pressure, and embrace challenges as opportunities to grow. My military background has given me strong discipline, adaptability, and problem-solving skills, qualities I now apply to my work in technology and programming.\n\nI also have a passion for design and its ability to inspire and connect with people, blending creativity with technical precision to create meaningful digital experiences."
